## Usage
The New York Times App allows you to search the New York Times API database with a simple keyword and click of the "Search" button. You can narrow your search down by choosing a start and end year for the search results and you also have the option to choose between 5 to 10 search results that will populate the “Top Articles” column. To clear the past articles found and begin your search again, simply hit the “Clear Results” button.
